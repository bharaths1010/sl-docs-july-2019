Agenda
***************

1. Installation and Configuration
2. Plugins
3. Security and Access Control
  => Manage Jenkins => Configure Global Security
4. Global Tool settings
    -> Install the tool on jenkins master/Slave
    -> Install appropriate Jenkins plugin using "Manage Plugins" under "Manage Jenkins"
    -> Configure Environment for the tool inside "Global Tool Settings"
5. Create some pipelines and jobs
6. Upstream/downstream projects
  -> Upstream (triggers) ==> Downstream


7. Parameterized builds
8. Build Slave architecture
9. Build Triggers

***************
Keywords
***************

Job = Project (Can be used interchangeably)
Build => Interation of a specific job
.jpi / .hpi
hudson => Jenkins
Jenkins home folder => /var/lib/jenkins
Working directory (Workspace) /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/<project_name>/


=====================
Definition
=====================

Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.


=====================
Installation and Configuration
=====================
https://jenkins.io/download/

## Install and verify Java
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk
java -version

## Add key
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -

## Add the following entry in your /etc/apt/sources.list:

deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/
or
sudo echo "deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list

## Update and install Jenkins
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y

##Access Jenkins Server on a web browser:
<ipaddress>:8080

## Copy the initialAdminPassword using the following command and paste in the browser window:
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword

AAA of Security
*****************

A => Authentication
    (MFA => Multi-Factor Authentication)
    - What you know => Credentials
    - What you have => RSA/SoftToken/OTP
    - What you are  => Biometric

A => Authorization
A => Accounting / Auditing / Logging


*****************
Maven Goals
*****************

mvn compile / test
- compile
- test
- clean install
- package (.jar /.war)
- deploy


1. Plugin Installation (Maven plugin is installed by default)
2. Install the package on the machine (Jenkins Master or Slave)
3. Configure the path / variable (Manage Jenkins => Global Tool Configuration)

Exercise:

1. Create a maven project/Job
2. set up maven in global tool Configuration
3. run the project and see if it successful.
